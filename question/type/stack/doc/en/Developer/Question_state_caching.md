# Question state caching

## Background ##

To increase efficiency and reliability STACK uses a dynamic cache to store versions of the items.

In STACK 1.0 question versions were generated on the fly from a stored seed which was used to
generate any random question variables.  Each of these initial instantiations and all subsequent
states required a relatively costly call to the CAS.

The current cache is very close indeed to the CAS.  Indeed, it
is actualy calls to the CAS itself which are cached.  This
gives a dramatic increase in performance when the result
already exists.  We need to monitor the database to see how
this works in practice.

## Clearing the cache ##

This can be done through Moodle.

Navigate to

     Home > Site administration > Plugins > Question types > Stack

Choose to view the Healthcheck page.  At the bottom of this is
a button to clear the cache.
