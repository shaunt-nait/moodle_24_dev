# How to translate STACK

STACK is part of Moodle.  Hence, we have used the Moodle translation management system.  

Please check if STACK has already been translated into your language.  We are using [Moodle's AMOS system](http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/AMOS) to do this.  

_ALL_ strings which appear to the user should be found in the single file

You need to translate the strings for the Components `qtype_stack`,
`qbehaviour_adaptivemultipart`, `qbehaviour_dfcbmexplicitvaildate`,
`qbehaviour_dfexplicitvaildate` and `qformat_stack`.

It is convenient to translate the strings online.  To translate STACK into another language please use Moodle's AMOS system.  See [Moodle online documentation](http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/AMOS) for specific details.

Apologies to those people who have translated STACK through AMOS, but who do not appear here. Please contact Chris Sangwin to add your name to the credits.

# Multilingual materials

Colleagues have asked for multilingual materials.  We plan to implement this using Moodle's Multi-language content filter, see
[http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Multi-language_content_filter](http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Multi-language_content_filter).
