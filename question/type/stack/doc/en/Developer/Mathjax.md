# Displaying mathematics in moodle #

STACK generates LaTeX code on the fly and expects a moodle filter to convert this into something the user's browser will display.  There are a variety of mathematics filters for moodle.  Currently when installing STACK there is the option to choose which filter mechanism is used.   This enables STACK to fine tune the output.  Support is currently provided for

1. MathJax, <http://www.mathjax.org>, the default.
2. Moodle Tex filter.

One reason for adopting MathJax is that it speaks mathematics, so will aid [accessibility](../Students/Accessibility.md).

These instructions are adapted from http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=193064

### Option 1: link to external MathJax setup. ###

If you want to use MathJax with all themes of your moodle 2.x.x the easiest way is to include it in the head of every page.

1. Admin -> Appearance -> Additional HTML -> Within HEAD
2. Put the following script in it and save

`<script type="text/x-mathjax-config"> MathJax.Hub.Config({`<br>
`        MMLorHTML: { prefer: "HTML" },`<br>
`        tex2jax: {`<br>
`            displayMath: [['\\[', '\\]']],`<br>
`            inlineMath:  [['\\(', '\\)']],`<br>
`            processEscapes: true`<br>
`        },`<br>
`        TeX: { extensions: ['enclose.js'] }`<br>
`      });`<br>
`</script>`<br>
`<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>`

Please note the following.

* These settings enable only the strict LaTeX maths environments, and does not support the use of dollars;
* The `processEscapes` flag enables you to include a dollar symbol in mathematics environments with `\$`.
* The line `TeX: { extensions: ['enclose.js'] }` enables support for [actuarial notation](../Authoring/Actuarial.md).

### Option 2: install MathJax locally. ###

A local installation may be preferable, e.g., if you want your STACK-equipped Moodle to work off-line, or if you want to try to speed up LaTeX rendering.

1. Download [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/)
2. Unpack the archive and rename folder to "mathjax".
3. Place the mathjax folder in .../moodle/lib and set appropriate ownership, e.g., `chown -R root.root mathjax`.
4. Carry out the procedure in Option 1, editing the script above to reflect your path to MathJax. The last line can resemble the following:<br>
`<script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost/moodle/lib/mathjax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>`

### What about mathml? ###

STACK contains experimental code to generate presentation mathml on the fly from maxima expressions.  This is currently unused, and may be pursued again in a future version.  Note that since question authors will be writing LaTeX mathematics fragments in many fields, having Maxima generate mathml is not sufficient.  We still need to convert user-entered mathematics in to mathml.

### What about dollar mathematics delimiters? ###  {#delimiters}

Please note that we strongly discourage the use of dollar symbols for denoting LaTeX mathematics environments such as `$...$` and `$$...$$` for inline and displayed mathematics respectively.  
The reasons are (1) they do not match, which makes parsing more difficult, and (2) many courses use [currency](../Authoring/CASText.md#currency) which needs this symbol and protecting it is always problematic.

If you have extensive existing materials using these delimiters then we have scripts which will automatically convert them for you.  All fields within existing questions can be converted with the automatic scripts available from

    Home > Site administration > Plugins > Question types > STACK

If you have ad-hoc text to convert then the CAS chat script *always* converts dollars into the forms `\( .... \)`and `\[ .... \]`.  You can test and edit the display of text in this window to see the conversion. 

If you really want to use dollars, MathJax can display them with the code

`        displayMath: [['$$', '$$'], ['\\[', '\\]']],`<br>
`        inlineMath:  [['$',  '$' ], ['\\(', '\\)']],`

Before deciding to support the use of dollars for mathematics on your site, please see the notes on the use of dollars for [currency](../Authoring/CASText.md#currency).
