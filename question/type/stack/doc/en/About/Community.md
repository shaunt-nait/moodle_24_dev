## How do I keep up to date with announcements about STACK?

We will make announcements about progress and developments with STACK on the [Moodle maths tools](http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=752) forum.

## How do I report a bug?

But reports are always very welcome.  Please try to make sure it is really not a bug with your question!  Where possible, please export a minimal question and a clear description of how to recreate the bug.  Issues such as this can be reported on [github](http://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/issues).

## How do I request a new feature?

Please look at the ideas we have for our [development track](../Developer/Development_track.md) and [future plans](../Developer/Future_plans.md).  If your request does not appear here, then please email the developers to discuss it.  Alternatively, you are very welcome to start a new issue on [github](http://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/issues) to discuss it.

## How do I submit my code changes?

Submit a pull request https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack, or one of the other plugins. If you are not yet familiar with git, please talk to us about your changes, and we will help. Actually, it is probably a good idea to talk to us about proposed changes before you make them in any case.

## How do I share my experiences using STACK?

Please do research and publish your experiences of using STACK with students.  A list of [publications](Publications.md) is available.
