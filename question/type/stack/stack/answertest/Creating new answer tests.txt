Adding answer tests to STACK

Changelog: Version 15th February 2011 - Chris Sangwin

****************************

There are 3 types of answer tests:
    A) Those which use a Answertest built into Maxima (E.g. in assessment.mac).
    B) Those which use standard CasText to perform a calculation and derive an answer.
    C) Those which use PHP to perform some calculation or comparison.

Common Background Information
-----------------------------
Each answertest is potentially stored as a individual object,
in a individual file in the answertest directory. In most
cases, (A), we have just one class which does all the work.
This prevents duplication of code.

Normally, just three methods are needed, the constructor which
calls the super class's constructor, a do_test() method which
does the work and a helper function process_atoptions() which
decides if the options need to be evaluated by the CAS in the
context of this question before the test is allowed. For
example, you might ask students for a random number of
significant figures. No other public methods are allowed.

The do_test() method should return true or false depending on
the result. If an error occurs the do_test() should return
null.

A) Maxima Answertests
---------------------
Open assessment.mac and add or link to the Maxima code to
perform the answertest.

The Maxima function must return information in the correct
[Validity,RawMark,AnswerNote,FeedBack]

Validity must be true/false
RawMark must be true/false
AnswerNote is a string.
FeedBack is a string - later translated by STACK.

To turn this Maxima list into something which the PHP interface can deal with,
STACK calls the Maxima function StackReturn() defined in stackmaxima.mac

The prototype is ATAlgEquiv, but a simpler test is
ATCasEqual.

B) CAStext Answertests
----------------------

CAStext answer tests are the most complex to create. Here we
can create a bespoke CAS session with the required commands and
mix some maxima with some PHP logic.

(See stack_anstest_numabsolute for an example).

C) PHP Answertests
------------------
For an example see stack_anstest_stringsloppy


Adding the new Answertest to STACK
---------------------------------

Open factory.class.php, passes information onto the correct
answertest class. There are plenty of examples here.
