# STACK 2.0 question importer

This Moodle question import format can import questions exported from a
STACK 2.0 system into Moodle with STACK 3.0 installed
(https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/). It was created by
Matti Pauna and Chris Sangwin.

To install, either [download the zip file](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qformat_stack/zipball/master),
unzip it, and place it in the directory `moodle\question\behaviour\stack`.
(You will need to rename the directory `moodle-qformat_stack -> stack`.)
Alternatively, get the code using git by running the following command in the
top level folder of your Moodle install:

    git clone git://github.com/maths/moodle-qformat_stack.git question/format/stack

For full install instructions, see the [STACK install instructions](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Installation/index.md).
