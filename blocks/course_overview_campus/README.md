moodle-block_course_overview_campus
===================================
Moodle block which provides all functionality of block_course_overview, provides additional filters (course category, course term and course teachers) to be used on university campuses as well as the possibility to hide courses and course news from the course list.

Installation
============
Install the plugin like any other plugin to folder
/blocks/course_overview_campus

See http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins


Placement
=========
block_course_overview_campus is used ideally as sticky block and placed on your frontpage (and mymoodle page, if your moodle instance uses this pagetype).

See http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Sticky_blocks for details about sticky blocks


Usage & Settings
================
After installing block_course_overview_campus with its default settings and adding it to your frontpage, it behaves like block_course_overview from moodle core. Additionally, news from your courses can be folded and unfolded and courses can be hidden from the course list.

To make use of the advanced features of the block, please visit Plugins -> Blocks -> Course overview on campus.

There, you find five sections:

1. Filter activation
--------------------
By checking one of these items, you activate a filter which enables your users to filter their courses by category, by term or by teachers. As soon as the filter is activated and the setting is saved, the filter appears in the block view.

2. Term definition
------------------
To make meaningfully use of the term filter, you have to configure it according to your campus course of the year and campus terminology. First, select if your year is divided into one, two, three or four terms. Then, set the start days of each term. After that, set a label for each term according to your campus terminology (multilang strings are supported, see http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Multi-language_content_filter for details).

3. Term behaviour
------------------
Here, you are able to let block_course_overview_campus choose a default term if the user has not previously selected a term for filtering terms.

4. Timeless courses
------------------
Here, you can enable support for "timeless courses". Timeless courses will be presented in the term filter as if they are not associated to a specific term. This is achieved by leveraging the course's start year field. After enabling timeless courses, you have to define a course start year threshold. Every course with a start year before (and not equal to) this year will be presentes as timeless course in the term filter.
You are also able to set a label for timeless courses for the term filter (multilang strings are supported, see http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Multi-language_content_filter for details).

5. Appearance
-------------
In this section, you can enable the displaying of the course's short name and of the teachers' names in the course list. Additionally, you can change the display names for each filter which are shown in the block view (multilang strings are supported, see http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Multi-language_content_filter for details).


Data sources
============

1. Category filter
------------------
The category filter is filled with the main category of each of the user's courses.
Currently, there is no support for parent categories, grandparent categories and so on or any other category filtering. Please don't hesitate to suggest expedient improvements.

2. Teacher filter
-----------------
block_course_overview_campus gets the list of teacher roles from $CFG->coursecontact. With this Moodle core setting, you can define which roles (and thereby which teachers) are displayed in block_course_overview_campus's teacher filter.

3. Term filter
--------------
As described in the "Usage & Settings" section of this file, you should configure block_course_overview_campus according to your campus course of the year. After that, block_course_overview_campus maps each course to a term by looking at the course's start date. This term is filled into the term filter.


Moodle 2.4 Features
===================
In contrast to previous Moodle versions, Moodle 2.4 added some features to the moodle core block_course_overview:
- In block_course_overview in Moodle 2.4, a user is able to sort his course list by drag and drop. I decided to not adopt this feature for block_course_overview_campus because I think this would be conflict with the filtering / hiding feature and confuse users. In block_course_overview_campus, the course list remains sorted by full course name.
- In block_course_overview in Moodle 2.4, the administrator can configure the block to show Metacourse children. I decided to not adopt this feature for block_course_overview_campus because we have no need for this. If you need this feature, please let me know on https://github.com/abias/moodle-block_course_overview_campus/issues
- In block_course_overview in Moodle 2.4, the administrator can configure the block to show a welcome message. I decided to not adopt this feature for block_course_overview_campus because we have no need for this. If you need this feature, please let me know on https://github.com/abias/moodle-block_course_overview_campus/issues
- In block_course_overview in Moodle 2.4, course news are grouped by modules and each module can be collapsed / expanded. I decided to stick with the behaviour of block_course_overview_campus to collapse / expand course news as a whole, but I added some nice icons for each module to the course news list.


MNet courses
============
In contrast to the moodle core block_course_overview, this block doesn't support MNet courses and wasn't tested with MNet Moodle installations.


Themes
======
block_course_overview_campus should work with all themes from moodle core.
block_course_overview_campus provides a fallback for browsers with JavaScript disabled.

Moodle release support
======================
Due to limited ressources, block_course_overview_campus is only maintained for the most recent major release of Moodle. However, previous versions of this plugin which work in legacy major releases of Moodle are still available as-is without any further updates in the Moodle Plugins repository.

There may be several weeks after a new major release of Moodle has been published until I can do a compatibility check and fix problems if necessary. If you encounter problems with a new major release of Moodle - or can confirm that block_course_overview_campus still works with a new major relase - please let me know on https://github.com/abias/moodle-block_course_overview_campus/issues


Right-to-left support
=====================
This plugin has not been tested with Moodle's support for right-to-left (RTL) languages.
If you want to use this plugin with a RTL language and it doesn't work as-is, you are free to send me a pull request on
github with modifications.
